By having these already generated and ready to go, this will shave off the time it needs to create the links.\n- Reaction images: Some reaction images from Nevira are now in Unifier!\n- Retain webhook cache on module reloads so a bugfix doesn't wipe it\n- More optimizations for even more performance gains (hopefully) :muscle:\n- Prefix is now softcoded in config.json\n\n**:warning: WARNING :warning:**: Please add your prefix in the `prefix` key in config.json for the bot to work post-reboot!\n**NOTE**: Please create a `cached` folder in Unifier's root folder for reaction images support!"
