  Unifier</h1>
<p align=center>A sophisticated Discord bot uniting servers and platforms, brought to you by Green and ItsAsheer<br>
Inspired by matrix-t2bot</p>

## What is Unifier?
Unifier is a bot written in Python which allows users to connect their Discord servers together to form one big chat room. 
It is also compatible with Revolt and Guilded with support extensions, meaning that it can also be used as a bridge bot to 
connect servers from different platforms together.

Unifier has:
- **The basic features**: Like most bridge bots, Unifier has basic commands such as link, unlink, etc.
- **A fast and responsive bridge**: Unifier's bridge uses threading to significantly improve the bridging speed, as well as
to minimize delay between servers and platforms.
- **Global-wide moderation commands**: Unifier admins can assign moderators, who can use a variety of moderation tools to
keep the chat safe for everyone.
- **Server-side moderation commands**: Server moderators can restrict certain members and servers from sending messages to
their server, even when they aren't banned by the bot.
- **Message cache backups**: Unifier's message cache is backed up on graceful shutdowns, so it remembers message IDs between
reboots for replying, editing, and deleting.
- **Message reporting**: Users can report messages to Unifier moderators, so they can more easily take action against bad
actors.
